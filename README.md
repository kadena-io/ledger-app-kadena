# Kadena Ledger App

## Device Compatability

This application is compatible with
- Ledger Nano S, running firmware 2.1.0 and above
- Ledger Nano S+, running firmware 1.0.3
- Ledger Nano X

Note: Compatibility with Ledger Nano X is only possible to check on [Speculos](https://github.com/ledgerHQ/speculos/) emulator,
because the Nano X does not support side-loading apps under development.

## Installing the app

If you don't want to develop the app but just use it, installation should be very simple.
The first step is to obtain a release tarball.
The second step is to load that app from the tarball.

### Obtaining a release tarball

#### Download an official build

Check the [releases page](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/ledger-app-kadena/releases) of this app to see if an official build has been uploaded for this release.
There is a separate tarball for each device.

#### Build one yourself, with Nix

There is a separate tarball for each device.
To build one, run:
```bash
nix-build -A $DEVICE.tarball
```
where `DEVICE` is one of
 - `nanos`, for Nano S
 - `nanox`, for Nano X
 - `nanosplus`, for Nano S+

The last line printed out will be the path of the tarball.

### Installation using the pre-packaged tarball

Before installing please ensure that your device is plugged, unlocked, and on the device home screen.
Installing the app from a tarball can be done using [`ledgerctl`](https://github.com/ledgerHQ/ledgerctl).

#### With Nix

By using Nix, this can be done simply by using the `load-app` command, without manually installing the `ledgerctl` on your system.

```bash
tar xzf /path/to/release.tar.gz
cd kadena
nix-shell
load-app
```

`/path/to/release.tar.gz` you should replace with the actual path to the tarball.
For example, it might be `~/Downloads/release.tar.gz` if you downloaded a pre-built official release from GitHub, or `/nix/store/adsfijadslifjaslif-release.tar.gz` if you built it yourself with Nix.

#### Without Nix

Without using Nix, the `ledgerctl` can be used directly to install the app with the following commands.
For more information on how to install and use that tool see the [instructions from LedgerHQ](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerctl).

```bash
tar xzf release.tar.gz
cd kadena
ledgerctl install -f app.json
```

## Using the app with generic CLI tool

The bundled `generic-cli` tool can be used to obtaining the public key and do signing.

To use this tool using Nix, from the root level of this repo, run this command to enter a shell with all the tools you'll need:
```bash
nix-shell -A $DEVICE.appShell
```
where `DEVICE` is one of
 - `nanos`, for Nano S
 - `nanox`, for Nano X
 - `nanosplus`, for Nano S+

Then, one can use `generic-cli` like this:

- Get a public key for a BIP-32 derivation:
  ```shell-session
  $ generic-cli getAddress "44'/626'/0'/0/0"
  a42e71c004770d1a48956090248a8d7d86ee02726b5aab2a5cd15ca9f57cbd71
  ```

- Sign a transaction:
  ```shell-session
  $ generic-cli sign --json "44'/626'/0'/0/0" '{"networkId":"mainnet01","payload":{"exec":{"data":{"ks":{"pred":"keys-all","keys":["368820f80c324bbc7c2b0610688a7da43e39f91d118732671cd9c7500ff43cca"]}},"code":"(coin.transfer-create \"alice\" \"bob\" (read-keyset \"ks\") 100.1)\n(coin.transfer \"bob\" \"alice\" 0.1)"}},"signers":[{"pubKey":"6be2f485a7af75fedb4b7f153a903f7e6000ca4aa501179c91a2450b777bd2a7","clist":[{"args":["alice","bob",100.1],"name":"coin.TRANSFER"},{"args":[],"name":"coin.GAS"}]},{"pubKey":"368820f80c324bbc7c2b0610688a7da43e39f91d118732671cd9c7500ff43cca","clist":[{"args":["bob","alice",0.1],"name":"coin.TRANSFER"}]}],"meta":{"creationTime":1580316382,"ttl":7200,"gasLimit":1200,"chainId":"0","gasPrice":1.0e-5,"sender":"alice"},"nonce":"2020-01-29 16:46:22.916695 UTC"}'
  ```

Alternatively the contents of JSON could be copied to a file, and the name of the file could be used in the command-line instead. This is necessary when the size of the JSON being signed is very big, as the command-line has limits to the length.

The following command demonstrates signing a big transaction specified in the file `./ts-tests/marmalade-tx.json`

  ```shell-session
  $ generic-cli sign --file --json "44'/626'/0'/0/0" ./ts-tests/marmalade-tx.json
  ```
